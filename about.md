<p class="message">
  Hey there!  I created this blog in an effort to document my progress as I learn to code using primarily online resources.  I hope it will also serve as a record of all that I learn through the process.
</p>

This blog was created using a Jekyll template built on Poole and made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).  The theme is called Hyde.
