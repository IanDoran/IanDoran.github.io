title: The Fear of Making Mistakes
---

I am surprised how daunting the fear of making mistakes can be even at my age and after 12 years of being an engineer.  You would have thought I would have learned to live with mistakes by this point.  I find it interesting how difficult it can be to start a project due to the fear of making mistakes.  Especially when it is obvious I will make nothing but mistakes.  I still struggle to forge ahead with just committing the mistake and cleaning it up later.  I wonder if that is an indication that in my professional life I have learned to avoid making mistakes, which would lead me to believe that I am not the risk taker I perceive myself to be.  Maybe there is a slight difference between making calculated risks and pressing on like a bull in a china shop, but I canâ€™t quite put my finger on it.
