The past year has been one for the hisory books.  This attempt to learn to code fell apart when I got promoted and my work responsibilities kicked in to high gear.
On top of that the pandemic hit and life has never been the same.  I thought at the start of the the pandemic that it would be the perfect opportunity to continue on this journey, but it turned out to be quite the opposite.
Despite working from home I found it difficult to focus on obligations beyond work and family.  I have little to show for the past year in personal acomplishments, but I feel like that has been a common experience.
I have watched several people on Twitter thrive during this time and wish I had their stamina.

All that being said I have finally returned to work on this personal goal.  I hope to pick up where I left off with a renewed sense of purpose.  I am thinking of taking on the 100 Days of Code challenge to help keep me accountable.  
Time is no more plentiful these days, but I am returning with a sense of purpose.  There is so much to learn and discover.  Time to get back at it.
