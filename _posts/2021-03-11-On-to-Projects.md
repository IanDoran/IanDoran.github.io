title: On to Projects
---

One of the things I have struggled with is starting and completing projects.  I have done some simple stuff for some of the online classes I have taken, but in general I have shied away from them, I think because of a lack of confidence.  As I work through the Free Code Camp material I am trying to take a new focus on projects because I am realizing how important they are for learning.  I have picked up many of the basics in my online learning so far, but I canâ€™t deny that it is in building a project that really forces you to learn the material.  I feel like online courses help familiarize you with the tools and methods, but the projects are where I really learn.  My main effort is not to procrastinate and really just buckle down and do them quickly.  I may get better at regular blog posts as they are another great way to procrastinate.
