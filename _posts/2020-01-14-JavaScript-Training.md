title: Javascript Basics
---
I decided to spend some time working on Javascript basics since I am submitting all my ProjectEuler100 problems in that language.  It is very similar to C but I don't really know a ton of C anyway.  The basic concepts presented so far appear to me to be a sytax similar to C but with a functionallity similar to python.
I also need to learn more markdown just so that I can write this blog in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
I also need to find a good text editor for writing in markdown.
So many things to do.

Later that night... I spent a couple hours working on problem 4 for ProjectEuler100.  There are numerous challenges with this problem, the first of which is my lack of knowledge of the functions and syntax in javascript.  I feel like I have made a lot of progress, but there is just so much to learn.  I feel like I need ot come up with a reference sheet or cheat sheet, but I'm not sure how to structure it.  

I keep  attcking the problem one little piece at a time, but I still feel like I am missing big parts of how to complete it efficiently.  I still feel like I am taking the right approach by not looking at other solutions and trying to figure it out on my own first, but it sure seems like the long painfull way to do it.
