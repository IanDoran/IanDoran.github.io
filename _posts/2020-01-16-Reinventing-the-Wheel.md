I am loving working on Project Euler problems.  It is forcing me to go out and learn a lot of basics, but I can't help but feel like I'm reinventing the wheel.

There are a bunch of methods out there to use javascript to find the largest value in an array, but I am creating nested for loops to do it.  I feel like on some level that should help reinforce the fundamentals, something I would expect from formal training.

What I would really like to do is find the time and go back and refactor all these programs as I develop a better understanding of code.  Not sure if I will be able to find the time to do that soon.
