title: Organizing My Thoughts
---

I feel like I'm juggling 10 balls at the moment. I am trying to find time to study, network, code, and live the rest of my. I'm still trying to learn how to use this blogging too while at the same time as posting things. I have given up on trying to have polished product before I put them out in the world.  As such, the next few press will probably be short and rough.

I have spent a lot of mental energy recently trying to convince myself that putting out unfinished work is better than nothing at all.  I guess only time will tell.
