title: Learning about Objects in Javascript
---

I have been struggling the past couple with learning objects in Javascript.  Accessing and writing values to complex objects can be a real challenge.  Dot notation vs. bracket notation is not very clearly spelled out in the material I am working with.  Freecodecamp is a great resource but it is somewhat minimalist in its explanation of concepts.
I was able to have a great conversation with a friend about Javascript and felt like many of the questions I have about it arent completely out in left field. 

I'm almost done with the freecodecamp Javascript tutorial.  I'm not entirely sure what I will try to tackle next.
