Here goes my first log post on this coding journey I have undertaken.  I have been at it for about a month and a half and have finally gotten around to documenting my progress.  It has been a struggle to dedicate the time to documentation since my time is so limited.  There is so much to learn and it is quite the struggle to carve out meaningfull chunks of it outside of work and family.  Like right now I can't go 2 minutes without one of the two kids asking me a question or interrupting me.  This has been going on for the past three hours.  Sometimes I find it amazing that I can accomplish anything.

I am hoping this will provide an outlet for me to document my thoughts thought this process as well as become a resource for me in the future to keep track of all the information I collect and am exposed to through this.

I think I will use this first part as a kind of mission statement for myself, so I may come back to it and realised as things evolve.
