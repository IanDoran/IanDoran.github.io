title: Project Euler Continues
---

I have continued to struggle with problem 4.  I approached it by trying to make the most complicated solution imaginable.  That combined wiht the fact that I though that returning the factors was part of the required solution has really slowed me down.  I am getting towards a much more compact code, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet.

I have had to learn a bunch of new javascript.  For example; how to break out of a for loop to a specific part of the code.  Also cow to convert between strings and integers.  All in all its a good learning experience, but slow.  

Well, the struggle continues tomorrow.
