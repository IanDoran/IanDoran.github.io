title: Continuing with CSS
---

Picking up where I left off I am trying to create my first project for Free Code Camp.  It is a simple tribute website but requires me to finally put together the bits and pieces of HTML and CSS I've learned over the past weeks and months.  There really isnâ€™t a better way to learn than by doing.  I have already had to work through a bunch of issues with precedents and understanding which rules get precedence.  I found a great site called Selectutorial that has some great explanations of CSS selectors.  I feel like the desire to do something original and not copy previous work has been holding me back on some of these projects. I have found a good balance of taking work I find and tweaking it in a way that forces me to understand the mechanics of the features.
