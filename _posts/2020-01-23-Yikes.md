title:  "Yikes, it's been a while"

Well, somehow almost a week has gone by since I last wrote.  Work has been hectic to say the least.  I have been struggling to acomplish everything I should be doing including keeping up with this blog.  
I have continued to progress on my Javascript studying and am almost done with the first module on freecodecamp.  I didn't code anything yesterday for the first time in a while.  I find that amazing because for the first moth of this journey I coded very little and focused more on lectures and such.
Now I am much more comfortable with just sitting down and writing an algorythm even if it is very simple.  I have finally gotten to the point where I need to take notes.  I guess that is probably a good indication that I am getting into more challenging topics.  I'm working on object oriented programming now.  I'm very curious to find out if it is really as challenging as I expect.
I feel like there has been a lot of hype regarding OO programs.  We'll see.
